# INN Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include changes of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.

- The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers' booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.

- The cancellation of bookings potentially impacts a hotel on various fronts:

  - Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.
  - Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.
  - Lowering prices at last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.
  - Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.
